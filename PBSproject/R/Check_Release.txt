***** Temporary display until R code is developed. *****

Check and release:

check() updates the documentation, then builds and checks the package locally.
check_win() checks a package using win-builder, and 
check_rhub() checks a package using r-hub. 
This allows you to easily check your package on all systems CRAN uses before submission.

release() makes sure everything is ok with your package 
(including asking you a number of questions), then builds and uploads to CRAN.
