PBSproject Changes
===================================
Authors:  JTS = Jon T. Schnute
          RH  = Rowan Haigh
-----------------------------------

0.0.9 (2023-01-12) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Moved the common dot functions in projects to a separate template file `dotProject.r' under `./templates/rcode'.
    + The template file `pbsProject.r' is now largely empty but could be filled with functions specific to style 0 (default).
    + Both files (`pbsProject.r' and `dotProject.r') are merged in the function `createProject' to appear as previously.
  * GUI code
    + Updated the template GUI to appear more compact (less wasted space).
  * Documentation
    + Modified the introduction vignette `PBSprojectIntro.Rnw' (and `.pdf').

0.0.8 (2023-01-12) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * R code
    + Updated code to remember user choices through the PBS options manager. (RH 230112)
      - Changed function name `.win.setPBSext' to `.win.setPBSopt'.
      - Code checks output options file `<project>Opts.txt' for previous settings.
    + Moved non-GUI dot functions from template file `pbsProject.r' to main function set `dotFuns.r'
      - functions moved: `.is.empty' and `do.backup'

0.0.7 (2023-01-10) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * First R package build for PBSproject
  * R code
    + Add new function `openProject'.
    + Implemented stored options by user (using PBS options manager).
    + Changed names of templates from `projectTemplate' to `pbsProject'.
  * Documentation
    + Added vignette called `PBSprojectIntro'
    + Added Rd help files:
      - `createProject.Rd', `openProject.Rd'

0.0.6 (2022-12-30) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Abandoned GUI control and implemented command line `createProject' that uses two template files ('projectTemplate.r' and 'projectTemplateWin.txt').
  * GUI code
    + Added multiple help references to a menu system.
  * Sage
    + Does not like having to source the code and wants everything wrapped up into an R package.
    + Prefers `createProject' to simply create two new project files (e.g., `xxx.r' and `xxxWin.txt') with no GUI.
      - Template files would remain safe in the package environment.
      - Suggested a `style' argument for createProject that could choose from a variety of template styles.
    + Request second function `openProject' that would create a GUI from the specified project.


0.0.5 (2022-11-24) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Refined the code further but still uses intermediary code sets.
  * Sage
    + Does not like initial master control GUI to create project GUIs.
      - Would prefer a command line function 'createProject' to get the ball rolling.

0.0.4 (2022-11-22) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Refined the juggling of self-perpetuating GUIs but still required an intermediary set of R/GUI code.
  * Sage
    + Does not like intermediary sets.

0.0.3 (2022-11-17) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Scaled back to bare-bones functionality (removed options manager component)
  * Sage
    + Collaborators are not understanding each other so project stripped back to the the most basic form.

0.0.2 (2022-11-15) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Added `guiFuns.r' and modified other R code files.
    + Enhanced the manipulation of user-specied options.
  * Sage
    + Too complicated (code is running ahead of design)

0.0.1 (2022-11-04) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * R code
    + Started PBSproject with modified functions from PBSadmb (RH 231104)
      - `projects.r', `optFuns.r', `utilFuns.r'
  * GUI code
    + Added `projectsWin.txt' and `PRJopts.txt'
  * Sage
    + Seems a bit too complicated but good first effort.
