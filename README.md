## PBSproject: Managing Projects and Packages ##
&copy; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2022-2023)

**PBSproject** provides software to facilitate the creation and management of projects and packages. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to manipulate projects through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 


**PBSproject** represents just one of a series of R packages developed at the Pacific Biological Station (<a href="http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/index-eng.html#pbs">PBS</a>) in Nanaimo, British Columbia. This particular package has undergone a number of reshapes based on design philosophy, but ultimately aims to facilitate project management. The current repository is very much a *work in progress*.
